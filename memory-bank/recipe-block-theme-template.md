# Recipe Block Theme Template Implementation

## Issue
The enhanced recipe plugin (`pcs-enhanced-recipes`) was causing conflicting header layout issues in the WordPress site. The plugin was using classic PHP templates that override the WordPress block theme templates, causing layout conflicts, particularly with the header.

## Solution Approach
Instead of modifying the plugin (which was the initial approach), we've created a proper block theme template and patterns for recipe content. This aligns with WordPress block theme best practices and provides a more maintainable and future-proof solution.

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created
1. **Block Theme Template**
   - `/wp-content/themes/pcs25/templates/single-recipe.html` - Replaced with a complete block-based template

2. **Block Patterns**
   - `/wp-content/themes/pcs25/patterns/recipe-social-share.php` - Social sharing buttons pattern
   - `/wp-content/themes/pcs25/patterns/recipe-print-button.php` - Print button pattern

3. **Assets**
   - `/wp-content/themes/pcs25/assets/css/social-share.css` - CSS for social sharing buttons
   - `/wp-content/themes/pcs25/assets/js/recipe-print.js` - JavaScript for print functionality

### Template Structure
The new single-recipe.html template includes:
- Proper template part references for header and footer
- Recipe print button at the top
- Two-column layout (66.66% / 33.33%) for recipe content and sidebar
- Integration with existing recipe patterns (details, ingredients, instructions, nutrition)
- New social sharing buttons section
- Sidebar with recipe categories, tags, and "More Recipes" sections
- Comments section at the bottom

### Enhanced Features
1. **Social Sharing**
   - Added buttons for Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Email sharing
   - Custom styling for social buttons with branded colors
   - Hover effects for better user experience

2. **Print Functionality**
   - Added print button with icon
   - Print stylesheet for optimized printed output
   - JavaScript support for print functionality

3. **JavaScript Integration**

### Theme Integration
