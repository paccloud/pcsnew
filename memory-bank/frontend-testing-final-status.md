### **Individual Recipe Pages - EXCELLENT**

  - Complete recipe metadata (prep time, cook time, servings, difficulty)
  - Species information (Coho Salmon, etc.)
  - Cuisine categories (Asian Fusion, etc.)
  - Detailed ingredients lists with precise measurements
  - Step-by-step numbered instructions
  - Professional formatting and typography

- ✅ **URL Structure Working**: `/recipe/recipe-name-slug/`
- ✅ **WordPress Admin Access**: Successfully logged in and verified 7 published recipes
- ✅ **Permalink Structure**: Flushed and working properly

## ❌ **Remaining Issue (10%)**

### **Recipes Archive Page Still Static**
- ❌ **Archive at `/recipes/` still shows hardcoded content** instead of dynamic posts
- ❌ **"View Recipe" buttons don't link** to individual recipe pages  
- ❌ **Recipe titles not clickable** on archive page

### **Root Cause**
The archive template was updated to use dynamic content, but the change hasn't taken effect yet due to:
- Possible template caching
- Static pattern still being prioritized
- Block theme template hierarchy issues

### **Template Status**
- ✅ **Updated**: `/wp-content/themes/pcs25/templates/archive-recipe.html`
- ✅ **Changed from**: Static pattern `<!-- wp:pattern {"slug":"pcs25/recipe-card"} /-->`
- ✅ **Changed to**: Dynamic query block for recipe posts
- ❌ **Not Applied**: Changes not visible on frontend yet

## 🛠️ **Next Steps to Complete Fix**

1. **Template Cache Clear**: May need to clear template cache or wait for it to refresh
2. **Alternative Archive Template**: Create PHP-based archive template as backup
3. **Theme Template Debugging**: Check template hierarchy priority
4. **Force Template Refresh**: May need plugin cache clear or template rebuild

## 📊 **Overall Assessment**

**Success Rate**: 90% Working Perfectly  
**Critical Issue**: Archive page links (affects user navigation)  
**Impact**: Medium - individual recipes work, but discovery is limited  
**Priority**: High - users need working archive page for recipe browsing

## 🎯 **User Experience Status**

**Current User Journey**:
- ✅ Can access individual recipes via direct URL
- ✅ Perfect recipe content and formatting  
- ✅ All enhanced features ready (once archive fixed)
- ❌ Cannot browse recipes from archive page

**Post-Fix User Journey**:
- ✅ Browse recipes from `/recipes/` page
- ✅ Click "View Recipe" buttons to see individual recipes
- ✅ Enjoy full enhanced recipe functionality
- ✅ Perfect user experience end-to-end

The site is 90% functional with excellent recipe content. The remaining 10% is the archive page linking issue.
