# AI Agent Process and Project Findings Summary

This document summarizes the process of working with an AI coding assistant (Cascade) for this project, how functionality is tested, and a summary of the efforts to add a "Recipes" link and page to the WordPress site.

## How AI Coding Assistants Work

AI coding assistants like Cascade operate through an iterative, tool-assisted process:

1.  **Understanding User Requests:** The AI processes natural language instructions to determine the task and objectives.
2.  **Information Gathering:**
    *   **Codebase Analysis:** The AI can read project files, search for specific code patterns, and list directory structures to understand the existing system.
    *   **External Knowledge:** It can perform web searches for documentation, error solutions, or best practices, and utilize specialized MCP servers for targeted information (e.g., library-specific docs).
3.  **Performing Actions (Tool Usage):
    *   **Code Modification:** The AI can create new files or edit existing ones based on the derived plan.
    *   **Command Execution:** It can run terminal commands (like WP-CLI) in the user's environment, though success depends on the environment's state and permissions.
    *   **Memory & Planning:** The AI maintains a persistent memory of key facts and a dynamic plan to track progress and adapt to new information.
4.  **Iterative Collaboration:** The AI proposes changes or actions, and the user provides feedback, observes results, and helps guide the process, especially for tasks requiring visual confirmation or interaction with a GUI.

## Testing Functionality with AI

Testing is a collaborative effort between the AI and the user:

*   **AI-Driven Checks:**
    *   **Tool Outputs:** The AI analyzes success/failure messages and data returned by its tools (e.g., error codes from commands, content of read files).
    *   **File Verification:** After code changes, the AI can re-read files to confirm modifications.
    *   **Logical Inference:** Based on code logic, the AI can infer expected outcomes.
*   **User-Driven Verification (Essential):
    *   **Visual Confirmation:** The user must verify UI changes, as the AI does not "see" the screen (e.g., confirming if a link appears in a browser).
    *   **Application Behavior:** Complex behaviors within applications (like WordPress admin actions, live site rendering, caching effects) require user observation.
    *   **Environment-Specific Issues:** Problems tied to the local development environment (like Local by Flywheel's specific configuration or database state) are typically identified by the user.

## Summary: Fixing Header Navigation & Recipes Page

**Initial Goal:** Add a visible and functional "Recipes" link to the site header, pointing to a recipe archive.

**Key Steps & Challenges:**

1.  **Theme Investigation:** Initially assumed `pcs25` was the active theme. Edits to its `patterns/header.php` and `parts/header.html` were ineffective.
2.  **Active Theme Identification:** Confirmed `Twenty Twenty-Five` as the active theme by inspecting the live site's footer and structure.
3.  **Header Link Attempts (Twenty Twenty-Five Theme):
    *   Edited `patterns/header.php`: Changes did not reflect live, possibly due to caching or Site Editor overrides.
    *   Edited `parts/header.html` directly: Link appeared as "(invalid)" in Site Editor (a known preview issue for custom post type archives), but still did not reliably appear on the live site for the user.
4.  **WP-CLI Issues:** Attempts to use WP-CLI for theme information, menu creation, or page creation consistently failed due to "Error establishing a database connection" within the Local by Flywheel environment. Database credentials provided by the user did not resolve this for CLI tool usage by the AI.
5.  **"Recipes" Page Creation Attempts:**
    *   **Standalone `recipes.php`:** A file was created at `/recipes.php` in the web root. While functional if accessed directly, this isn't a standard WordPress page and doesn't appear in WP Admin.
    *   **Automatic Page Creation via `functions.php`:** Code was added to `twentytwentyfive/functions.php` to:
        *   Automatically create a WordPress "Recipes" page (hooked initially to `after_setup_theme`, then to `admin_init` for persistence).
        *   Provide a `[display_recipes]` shortcode to list recipes on this page.
        *   **Outcome:** Despite these efforts, the user reported the "Recipes" page did not appear in the WP Admin > Pages list.

**Current Status (as of last interaction before this summary):**
*   The "Recipes" link is not reliably visible on the live site's header.
*   A WordPress "Recipes" page has not been successfully created and verified in the WP Admin area through programmatic means by the AI.
*   The `/recipe/` custom post type archive URL is confirmed to be working correctly when accessed directly.

## Key Findings & Blockers

*   **WP-CLI Database Connectivity:** Persistent database connection errors prevent effective use of WP-CLI by the AI in the user's Local by Flywheel setup. This hampers many standard WordPress management and troubleshooting tasks that could be automated.
*   **Theme/Site Editor Overrides & Caching:** Changes made directly to theme files (like `parts/header.html` or `functions.php`) are not consistently or reliably reflecting on the live site or in the WP Admin. This suggests that WordPress's Site Editor, theme template hierarchy, or caching mechanisms within the Local environment might be overriding these file-based changes. Diagnosing the exact cause is difficult without more direct environment access or functioning CLI tools.
*   **Programmatic Page Creation Issues:** The `functions.php` method to auto-create a page, even when hooked to `admin_init`, did not result in the page appearing for the user, indicating a deeper issue with how WordPress is initializing or recognizing these programmatic changes in this specific environment.

## Recommended Next Steps

Given the persistent issues with programmatic changes and WP-CLI:

1.  **Manual Page Creation:** The most reliable method to create the "Recipes" page is for the user to do it manually via **WP Admin > Pages > Add New**.
    *   Title: `Recipes`
    *   Content: Include a descriptive heading and the `[display_recipes]` shortcode (which should be functional from the `functions.php` additions).
2.  **Verify Manual Page:** Confirm the page is created, accessible via its permalink (e.g., `/recipes/`), and the shortcode displays recipes correctly.
3.  **Manual Header Link Update:** If the page works, the user should manually edit the header navigation via **WP Admin > Appearance > Editor > Header (or equivalent for Twenty Twenty-Five)** to add/update the "Recipes" link to point to the newly created page's URL.
4.  **Clear Caches:** After manual changes, clear all possible caches (browser, WordPress caching plugins if any, Local by Flywheel's internal caches if applicable).

This manual approach bypasses the environmental complexities that are currently blocking the AI's automated methods.
