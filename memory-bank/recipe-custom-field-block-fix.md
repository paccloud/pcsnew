# Recipe Custom Field Block Fix

## Issue
The recipe template was showing errors: "Your site doesn't include support for the 'core/post-custom-field' block. You can leave it as-is or remove it." This was happening because the WordPress installation didn't have proper support for the post-custom-field block.

## Solution Approach
Instead of relying on the post-custom-field block, which was causing errors, we implemented two complementary solutions:

1. Added proper support for the post-custom-field block in the theme's functions.php file
2. Updated recipe patterns to use PHP to directly fetch and display custom fields without relying on the post-custom-field block

## Implementation Details

### Added Custom Field Block Support
We added the following to functions.php:
1. A theme setup function that registers support for the post-custom-field block
2. A custom render callback function that properly renders custom fields
3. Registration of attributes for the custom field block

### Updated Recipe Patterns
We completely rewrote the following patterns to use direct PHP to fetch and display meta fields instead of relying on the post-custom-field block:

1. recipe-details.php - Gets prep time, cook time, servings directly from post meta
2. recipe-ingredients.php - Gets ingredients from post meta and converts to a list
3. recipe-instructions.php - Provides placeholder for instructions in the content
4. recipe-nutrition.php - Provides placeholder table for nutrition information

Each pattern now:
- Directly fetches meta values using get_post_meta()
- Uses server-side PHP to generate the block markup
- Maintains the same visual appearance and layout
- Avoids reliance on the problematic post-custom-field block

## Code Changes

### Added to functions.php:
```php
/**
 * Add theme support for core/post-custom-field block
 */
function pcs25_theme_setup() {
    // Add support for post-custom-field block
    add_theme_support('core-block-patterns');
    
    // Register support for custom fields block
    register_block_type(
        'core/post-custom-field',
        array(
            'render_callback' => 'pcs25_render_custom_field_block',
            'attributes' => array(
                'className' => array(
                    'type' => 'string',
                ),
                'key' => array(
                    'type' => 'string',
                ),
            ),
        )
    );
}
add_action('after_setup_theme', 'pcs25_theme_setup');

/**
 * Callback function to render custom field blocks
 */
function pcs25_render_custom_field_block($attributes, $content) {
    if (empty($attributes['key'])) {
        return '';
    }
    
    $post_id = get_the_ID();
    $meta_key = $attributes['key'];
    $meta_value = get_post_meta($post_id, $meta_key, true);
    
    if (empty($meta_value)) {
        return '';
    }
    
    $class_name = isset($attributes['className']) ? ' class="' . esc_attr($attributes['className']) . '"' : '';
    
    return sprintf(
        '<div%s>%s</div>',
        $class_name,
        esc_html($meta_value)
    );
}
```

### Complete Rewrite of Pattern Files:
- `/wp-content/themes/pcs25/patterns/recipe-details.php`
- `/wp-content/themes/pcs25/patterns/recipe-ingredients.php`
- `/wp-content/themes/pcs25/patterns/recipe-instructions.php`
- `/wp-content/themes/pcs25/patterns/recipe-nutrition.php`

## Implementation Date
March 7, 2025

## Files Modified
- `/wp-content/themes/pcs25/functions.php`
- `/wp-content/themes/pcs25/patterns/recipe-details.php`
- `/wp-content/themes/pcs25/patterns/recipe-ingredients.php`
- `/wp-content/themes/pcs25/patterns/recipe-instructions.php`
- `/wp-content/themes/pcs25/patterns/recipe-nutrition.php`

## Expected Results
- No more errors about missing post-custom-field block support
- Recipe details, ingredients, and other meta data will display correctly
- All recipe patterns will work properly with the block theme system
- Recipe content will be editable in the block editor
- Social sharing functionality will work as expected

## Long-Term Benefits
1. **Improved Compatibility**: Better compatibility with WordPress block theme standards
2. **Dual Approach**: Both direct PHP output and custom field block support for future flexibility
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Cleaner code that's easier to maintain and update
4. **User Experience**: Better editing experience without error messages 
5. **Performance**: Potentially better performance by using direct PHP instead of block rendering
