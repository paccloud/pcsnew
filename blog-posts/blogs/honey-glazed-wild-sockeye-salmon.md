## The Story Behind This Dish
This recipe highlights sustainably caught wild sockeye salmon from Alaska's pristine waters. Unlike farmed alternatives, these salmon swim freely in their natural environment, feeding on their natural diet, which gives them their distinctive rich color and flavor. The small-boat fishermen who harvest these salmon use careful handling techniques to ensure the highest quality, supporting not only ocean conservation but also the livelihoods of fishing families who have practiced responsible fishing for generations.
