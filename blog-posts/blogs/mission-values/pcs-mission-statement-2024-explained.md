# PCS Mission Statement 2024 Explained

The mission of Pacific Cloud Seafoods has always been: bring the best sourced seafood to consumers who Value it. 

There is a lot to unpack there and I want this blog post to shed light on what that means, starting with "Best Sourced". To us it means seafood that is harvested in a way that minimizes the impact to the resource overall. My personal experience and research has led me to source from small boats, co-ops, and processors who support those businesses.

Generally that includes community-based businesses, but occasionally multi-national businesses with aligned values will check the boxes as well. For instance, Canada, our close neighbor, has the same struggles as we do but they handle it differently.

## What Drives Our Business

The other part that matters to us when we say "best sourced" is what drives the business. Our goal is to exist. To pay our harvesters, partners and employees a living wage. That does not always translate into the cheapest seafood in town. Very often it results in a higher price.

But that higher price means something important - it means fair compensation throughout our supply chain, from the person who caught your fish to the person who handed it to you. It means we're not cutting corners on quality or sustainability to maximize profit margins.

## Transparency and Connection

In order to hit our goals, one of the new things we intend to invest in is storytelling and communication with our consumers and producers. We believe that when consumers understand the journey their seafood has taken, they're more likely to value it appropriately.

This means:
- Sharing the stories of the fishermen who catch your seafood
- Explaining our sourcing decisions and the reasons behind them
- Being honest about the challenges facing small-scale, sustainable fishing
- Creating meaningful connections between producers and consumers

## Quality Over Quantity

Another core aspect of our mission is prioritizing quality over quantity. We're not interested in moving the most product or growing at an unsustainable rate. Instead, we focus on providing exceptional seafood to people who recognize and appreciate the difference.

This means we sometimes:
- Carry less inventory to ensure everything is at peak freshness
- Turn down potential partnerships that don't align with our values
- Pay more to fishermen who take extra care with their catch
- Invest in proper handling and shipping to maintain quality

## Looking Forward

As we move into 2024, we're doubling down on our commitment to these principles. We believe that by staying true to our mission of bringing the best-sourced seafood to consumers who value it, we can create a business that not only survives but thrives - while supporting the communities and ecosystems that make our work possible.

We invite you to join us on this journey. Ask questions, learn about your seafood, and experience the difference that truly responsible sourcing makes. Together, we can create a more sustainable and equitable seafood system.
