- 2 tablespoons fresh dill, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
- 1 lemon, zested
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

### For the Lemon Caper Sauce:

- 2 tablespoons capers, drained and roughly chopped
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1/4 cup heavy cream

## Instructions
### Prepare the Halibut:
1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
2. Pat halibut fillets dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.
3. In a small bowl, combine panko, chopped herbs, and lemon zest.
4. Brush each fillet with Dijon mustard.
5. Press the herb mixture onto the top of each fillet, drizzle with olive oil.
6. Heat an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil.
7. Place halibut fillets herb-side up in the skillet and sear for 2 minutes.
8. Transfer skillet to preheated oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, until fish flakes easily with a fork but remains moist in the center (internal temperature of 135°F).

6. Stir in parsley, season with salt and white pepper to taste.

### To Serve:
1. Place halibut fillets on warmed plates.
2. Spoon the lemon caper sauce around (not over) the fillets to preserve the crispy herb crust.
3. Garnish with additional fresh herbs and lemon wedges if desired.
