## Difficulty Level

## Ingredients
- 6-8 large fresh sea scallops (day-boat or diver scallops preferred)
- 1 ruby red grapefruit, segmented with membrane and pith removed
- 8 orange cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/2 small red onion, sliced very thin
- Nasturtium and carrot micro greens (optional)
- Flaky sea salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Extra virgin olive oil (high quality)

### For the Vinaigrette
- Juice of 1 fresh lemon
- Equal amount of high-quality extra virgin olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

### Preparation
1. **Source Quality Scallops**: Ensure the scallops are as fresh as possible, preferably not more than 48 hours out of the ocean. Talk to your supplier to confirm the scallops' origin and harvest date. Choose day-boat scallops for the best quality.

2. **Prepare the Vinaigrette**: In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice, removing any seeds. Mix in enough olive oil to match the amount of lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Add the thinly sliced red onion to the vinaigrette and set it aside for at least 20 minutes to marinate and lightly pickle.

3. **Segment the Grapefruit**: Using a sharp knife, cut off the top and bottom of the grapefruit. Following the curve of the fruit, cut away the peel and white pith. Over a bowl to catch juices, carefully cut between the membranes to release the segments. Set aside.

4. **Prepare Your Workstation**: Arrange the grapefruit segments, halved cherry tomatoes, marinated red onions, and micro greens around your work area for efficient plating once the scallops are sliced.

### Handle the Scallops
1. **Clean the Scallops**: Remove the scallops from the refrigerator. Working quickly, remove the side muscle (a small rectangular tag of flesh attached to the side of each scallop) if present. Rinse briefly in ice-cold water and pat thoroughly dry with paper towels.

2. **Slice the Scallops**: Using a very sharp knife, slice the scallops horizontally into disks about 1/4 inch thick. Depending on the size of the scallops, you should get 3-4 slices per scallop. Keep the slices refrigerated until just before serving.

### Plating
1. **Arrange the Dish**: On chilled serving plates, arrange the scallop slices in a staggered line or circular pattern. Intersperse with grapefruit segments and cherry tomato halves for color contrast.

2. **Add the Pickled Onions**: Remove the red onion from the vinaigrette (reserving the liquid) and distribute among the plates.

3. **Dress the Dish**: Drizzle the reserved lemon vinaigrette over the scallops, grapefruit, and tomatoes. Be generous but not overwhelming—you want to enhance, not mask, the fresh flavors.

4. **Final Touches**: Garnish with micro greens if using. Finish with a light sprinkle of flaky sea salt, a few grinds of fresh black pepper, and a final drizzle of your best olive oil.

5. **Serve Immediately**: Serve the Sea Scallop Crudo right away for the freshest flavors and textures.

## Chef's Tips
- The quality of your ingredients is paramount in this raw preparation—invest in the freshest, highest-quality components possible
- Chill your plates in the freezer for 10 minutes before plating to help keep everything cold
- Work quickly once you begin slicing the scallops, as they are best served immediately after preparation
- This dish can be adapted seasonally—try stone fruit in summer or citrus variations in winter

## The Story Behind This Dish
This elegant crudo showcases the natural sweetness and buttery texture of sea scallops harvested from the cold, clean waters of the North Atlantic. Day-boat scallops are considered the premium choice because they're harvested on single-day fishing trips, meaning they reach shore and are processed within 24 hours of being caught.

Unlike some commercial scallop operations that use chemical preservatives or excessive soaking, the scallops we recommend for this dish are "dry" scallops—free from additives and showcasing their true natural flavor. These sustainable practices not only produce a superior culinary experience but also support the small-boat fishermen who are committed to responsible harvesting methods.

When served raw in this Italian-inspired crudo preparation, the subtle sweetness of fresh scallops pairs beautifully with acidic and bright accompaniments, creating a first course worthy of the finest restaurants but simple enough to prepare in your own kitchen.
