## Difficulty Level
Intermediate

## Ingredients
- 4 wild-caught Alaska sablefish (black cod) fillets (6 oz each), skin on
- 1/2 cup white miso paste
- 1/4 cup mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)
- 1/4 cup sake
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 green onion, thinly sliced (for garnish)
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds (for garnish)
- Lemon wedges, for serving

### Suggested Sides
- Steamed short-grain rice
- Bok choy or other Asian greens, lightly sautéed
- Pickled ginger or quick-pickled cucumber

## Instructions

### Prepare the Marinade:
1. In a small saucepan, combine miso paste, mirin, sake, brown sugar, rice vinegar, ginger, and garlic.
2. Heat over medium-low heat, whisking constantly until sugar dissolves and ingredients are well combined, about 3-4 minutes. Do not boil.
3. Remove from heat and let cool completely to room temperature.

### Marinate the Fish:
1. Pat the sablefish fillets dry with paper towels.
2. Place fillets in a glass baking dish or resealable plastic bag.
3. Pour the cooled marinade over the fish, turning to coat all sides thoroughly.
4. Cover dish or seal bag, refrigerate, and marinate for 24-48 hours. (Minimum 12 hours, but longer marination develops deeper flavor and better caramelization.)
5. Turn fish occasionally during marination if possible.

### Cook the Fish:
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil and lightly oil.
3. Remove fish from marinade, gently scraping off excess marinade with the back of a knife. (Some marinade should remain, but not too much as it can burn.)
4. Place fillets skin-side down on the prepared baking sheet.
5. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until fish flakes easily with a fork but still appears moist in the center.
6. For additional caramelization, switch oven to broil for the final 1-2 minutes, watching carefully to prevent burning.

### To Serve:
1. Transfer fillets to serving plates, skin-side down.
2. Garnish with sliced green onion and toasted sesame seeds.
3. Serve immediately with lemon wedges, steamed rice, and sautéed greens.

## The Story Behind This Dish
This preparation was made famous by Japanese chef Nobu Matsuhisa, whose signature black cod with miso has been imitated worldwide. The dish brilliantly highlights sablefish's extraordinary butter-like texture and rich flavor—qualities that result from its life in the cold, deep waters of Alaska.

Wild sablefish, also called black cod (though not actually a cod), is harvested from the depths of the North Pacific. These fish live at depths of up to 9,000 feet where they develop high oil content to withstand the cold and pressure—creating their signature silky texture. Small-boat longline fishermen in Alaska sustainably harvest this prized species using hooks that target specific sizes and minimize bycatch.

Unlike many seafood species that are threatened by overfishing, Alaska's sablefish fishery is meticulously managed to ensure long-term sustainability, making this luxurious dish not just a treat for your palate, but a responsible choice for the planet as well.
