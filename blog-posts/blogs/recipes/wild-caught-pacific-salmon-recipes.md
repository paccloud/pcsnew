## Cedar Plank Grilled King Salmon with Lemon-Herb Butter

### Description
This method infuses wild King (Chinook) salmon with a delicate smokiness from the cedar plank while maintaining the fish's natural moisture. The lemon-herb butter adds bright, complementary flavors without overwhelming the salmon's rich taste. Perfect for outdoor dining and special occasions.

### Preparation Time
- Prep: 15 minutes (plus 2 hours for soaking cedar plank)
- Cook: 12-15 minutes
- Total: 2.5 hours
- Servings: 4

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

### Ingredients
- 1 untreated cedar plank (about 14" x 7")
- 4 wild Alaska King salmon fillets (6 oz each), skin on
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 lemon, thinly sliced
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme

#### For the Lemon-Herb Butter:
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 2 tablespoons fresh herbs (combination of dill, chives, and parsley), finely chopped
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- Pinch of black pepper

### Instructions
1. Soak the cedar plank in water for at least 2 hours, placing a weight on top to keep it submerged.
2. When ready to cook, preheat grill to medium-high heat (about 375°F).
3. Prepare the lemon-herb butter by combining all ingredients in a small bowl. Mix thoroughly and set aside at room temperature.
4. Pat salmon fillets dry with paper towels. Brush both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
5. Place the soaked cedar plank on the preheated grill and close the lid. After 3-5 minutes, when the plank begins to smoke and crackle, it's ready for the salmon.
6. Arrange the salmon fillets skin-side down on the plank, leaving a little space between each piece.
7. Place lemon slices and thyme sprigs on and around the salmon.
8. Close the grill lid and cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the salmon is just cooked through but still moist inside (internal temperature of 125°F for medium).
9. Transfer the salmon to serving plates and top each fillet with a generous dollop of lemon-herb butter, allowing it to melt over the hot fish.
10. Serve immediately with additional lemon wedges if desired.

## The Story Behind Our Wild Salmon

The Pacific salmon featured in these recipes comes from the pristine waters of Alaska, where sustainable fishing practices have been mandated since statehood. Our salmon is harvested by small-boat fishermen who use selective methods like trolling, gillnetting, and purse seining to target specific species while minimizing impact on the marine ecosystem.

Unlike farmed salmon, wild Pacific salmon swim freely throughout their lives, developing the rich color, flavor, and nutritional profile that make them superior for cooking. Each variety offers unique characteristics:

- **King (Chinook)**: The largest and richest of all salmon, prized for its high oil content and buttery texture
- **Sockeye (Red)**: Known for its deep red flesh and robust flavor, making it excellent for bold preparations
- **Coho (Silver)**: Medium-rich with bright red flesh, offering a delicate flavor that works well in diverse recipes

Within moments of being caught, our salmon is cleaned, iced, and prepared for flash-freezing at temperatures reaching -40°F. This process locks in peak freshness, preserving both flavor and texture until the fish reaches your kitchen.

By choosing wild Alaska salmon for these recipes, you're not only treating yourself to exceptional seafood but also supporting sustainable fisheries and the coastal communities that depend on them.
