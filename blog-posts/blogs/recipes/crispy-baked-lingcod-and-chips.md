Roasted Potatoes (chips)

Lingcod

While potatoes are roasting, prepare fish.


Cut fish into 3-inch pieces, and set aside
In a medium-size bowl, combine the panko, dried thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper. 
Heat a skillet over medium low heat. Add the panko crumbs into the skillet and toast, stirring frequently for about 5 minutes or until golden brown. 
Remove from heat and stir in 1 tablespoon on oil. 
Transfer crumbs to a shallow bowl.
In another shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs and Dijon mustard, set aside.
In a third shallow bowl, put in the flour. 
Take each piece of fish, dredge in the flour, then completely coat in the Dijon mixture, then press fish in the panko crumbs. Ensure fish is completely coated in panko crumbs. 
Set the fish on the prepared baking sheet.
Continue with the remaining fish.
