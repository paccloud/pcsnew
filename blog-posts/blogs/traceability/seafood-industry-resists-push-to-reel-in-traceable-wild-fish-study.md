# Seafood Industry Resists Push to Reel in Traceable Wild Fish: Study

This is not surprising to anyone in the industry. Especially small scale, direct marketers. In 2018, my partner and I traveled to New York City to take part in the stories, seafood experience, put on by a project, called fish coin. Fish coin's goals were to incentivize traceability, and provide compensation to those good actors within the supply chain.

It was at the height of the crypto bubble, but what attracted me to the project was the technology and the core fundamentals, which I still align with.

In 2026 rules for the Food Safety Modernization Act will start to be enforced and many of these bad players will have to comply or face stiff consequences.

Companies like Seed to Table have already seen what can happen when they get a little lackadaisical with their recording as outlined in this 2019 article from the AP.

Companies like [ThisFish Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thisfish/), Envisible, Certified Quality Foods, are important to help with increasing transparency. They are fighting goliath, many of the large current players would rather you did not know everything about your fish.

[Seafood industry resists push to reel in traceable wild fish: Study](https://phys.org/news/2023-05-seafood-industry-resists-reel-traceable.html)

"The article published in the journal Technology in Society found an oligopoly of big seafood wholesalers and fish markets are reluctant to use traceability technologies, as a way of avoiding closer scrutiny on their supply chain practices."

## Understanding Industry Resistance to Traceability

The recently published study in Technology in Society provides valuable insights into why major players in the seafood industry resist adopting traceability technologies. While the headline findings might seem alarming, they reflect complex economic and operational realities that are important to understand.

### The Oligopoly Problem

The study identifies an "oligopoly" of large seafood wholesalers and markets who control significant portions of the seafood supply chain. These entities have established business models that benefit from limited transparency:

- **Flexible sourcing**: Without strict traceability, these companies can rapidly switch suppliers based on price and availability
- **Price opacity**: Limited information allows for greater markups without justification to consumers
- **Reduced accountability**: Less documentation means fewer avenues for questioning practices or origins
- **Competitive advantage protection**: Information about supplier relationships and sourcing channels is treated as proprietary business intelligence

This concentration of market power allows these major players to resist change, even as consumers increasingly demand more information about their seafood.

### The Technology Gap

The study also points to practical barriers to traceability adoption:

- **Legacy systems**: Many established seafood businesses operate on outdated inventory and tracking systems
- **Fragmented technologies**: Various traceability solutions aren't always compatible with each other
- **Implementation costs**: Upgrading to comprehensive traceability systems requires significant investment
- **Training requirements**: Staff need to learn new protocols and technologies
- **Perceived ROI concerns**: Many businesses don't see an immediate return on traceability investments

For small and medium-sized businesses, these barriers can be particularly challenging to overcome without support.

## Why Traceability Matters

Despite industry resistance, seafood traceability delivers crucial benefits across the value chain:

### Consumer Benefits

- **Health and safety**: Traceable seafood allows for faster, more targeted recalls when safety issues arise
- **Informed choices**: Consumers can select products aligned with their values regarding sustainability, fishing methods, or origin
- **Authenticity assurance**: Verification that the species, origin, and production method match label claims
- **Value confirmation**: Justification for premium prices for special attributes (e.g., day-boat, hook-and-line caught)

### Industry Benefits

- **Improved inventory management**: Better tracking means less waste and more efficient operations
- **Risk mitigation**: Reduced vulnerability to fraud and substitution within the supply chain
- **Market differentiation**: Ability to verify and market unique product attributes
- **Regulatory compliance**: Preparedness for increasing government requirements
- **Crisis management**: Ability to quickly isolate problems when issues arise

### Environmental Benefits

- **Verification of sustainable practices**: Confirmation that seafood comes from well-managed fisheries
- **Reduction of illegal fishing**: Traceable supply chains make it harder to introduce illegally caught fish
- **Data for management**: Better information about what's being caught where helps inform fisheries management
- **Accountability**: Creating links between fishing practices and market outcomes

## The Food Safety Modernization Act's Coming Impact

As mentioned in the introduction, the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) will begin enforcing traceability rules in 2026. These regulations will require companies to track and document the movement of certain foods, including many seafood products, throughout the supply chain.

### Key FSMA Requirements

The FSMA's traceability provisions include:

- **Critical Tracking Events**: Documentation of key points where food changes hands or form
- **Key Data Elements**: Specific information that must be recorded at each Critical Tracking Event
- **Electronic Records**: Systems capable of sharing standardized information quickly during investigations
- **24-Hour Recall Capacity**: Ability to trace products backward and forward within 24 hours

These requirements will fundamentally change how seafood businesses operate, forcing many resistant companies to adopt traceability technologies or face penalties.

## Pioneering Traceability Technologies

Despite resistance from industry giants, several innovative companies are developing solutions to make seafood traceability more accessible and effective:

### ThisFish Inc.

ThisFish's Tally software platform provides end-to-end traceability solutions specifically designed for seafood operations. Their technology allows processors and distributors to digitize production data while maintaining chain of custody information throughout the supply chain.

### Envisible

Envisible's Wholechain platform uses blockchain technology to create immutable records of seafood as it moves through the supply chain. Their approach focuses on making traceability beneficial for businesses while providing the transparency consumers demand.

### Certified Quality Foods

CQF offers testing and verification services that complement traceability technologies, validating claims about species, origin, production method, and quality.

These companies represent the future of seafood traceability—creating systems that are more efficient, accurate, and accessible than ever before.

## The Future of Seafood Traceability

Despite current resistance, the future of the seafood industry will inevitably include comprehensive traceability. Several factors will drive this transition:

### Regulatory Pressure

Beyond the FSMA, governments worldwide are implementing stricter traceability requirements to combat illegal fishing and seafood fraud.

### Market Demands

Retailers and foodservice companies increasingly require traceability documentation from their suppliers to meet consumer expectations and manage risks.

### Technological Advancement

Emerging technologies are making traceability more affordable, accessible, and beneficial for businesses of all sizes.

### Competitive Advantage

As more companies embrace transparency, those clinging to opacity will find themselves at a disadvantage in the marketplace.

### Industry Leadership

Forward-thinking seafood companies are demonstrating that traceability can be integrated into operations without undermining profitability.

## Conclusion

The resistance to traceability described in the Technology in Society study represents a industry in transition. While entrenched interests may resist change, the momentum toward greater transparency is unstoppable.

As consumers, we can accelerate this transition by supporting businesses that embrace traceability and asking questions about the origins of our seafood. By doing so, we not only protect ourselves from fraud and mislabeling but also help create a more sustainable, equitable seafood system for the future.
