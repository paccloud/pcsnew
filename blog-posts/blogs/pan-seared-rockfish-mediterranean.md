## Ingredients
- 4 wild Alaska rockfish fillets (6 oz each), sustainably caught
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 small red onion, finely diced

## Instructions
1. Pat rockfish fillets dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt, pepper, and smoked paprika.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
3. Add fish fillets and sear until golden and crisp, about 3-4 minutes per side. The fish should be almost cooked through. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely with foil.

5. Add red bell pepper and cook for another 2 minutes.

7. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes until slightly thickened.
8. Return fish to the skillet, nestling it into the sauce. Cook for 2-3 minutes until fish is heated through.
9. Scatter fresh basil and parsley over the dish.
10. Serve immediately with lemon wedges on the side.

## The Story Behind This Dish
Rockfish represents the diversity of Alaska's marine ecosystem, with over 30 different species swimming in its cold, clean waters. This particular recipe features Pacific rockfish, which is caught using hook-and-line methods that minimize habitat impact and allow fishermen to target specific species while avoiding unwanted bycatch. The small fishing boats that harvest rockfish are often family-owned operations that have been practicing sustainable fishing for generations. With strict catch limits and careful management, Alaska's rockfish fishery stands as a model of sustainability that ensures these delicious fish will remain abundant for future generations.
