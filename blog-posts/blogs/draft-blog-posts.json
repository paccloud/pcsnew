We know that food is medicine – that plant-based diets help our hearts, and turmeric helps our joints… </span><i><span>but what about our mental health? </span></i></p>\n<p><b> </b></p>\n<p><b>Let’s talk about Omega-3 fatty acids:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/09/food-mental-health\"><span>Omega-3 fatty acids</span></a><span> </span><span>have anti-inflammatory properties but also positively affect dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain, which are essential to regulating mood. Studies show that those who suffer from mood disorders and symptoms of depression may not have enough omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The Harvard Health Blog sites over 30 clinical trials testing omega-3 preparations in people with depression. The studies reveal that omega-3 fatty acids are promising natural treatments for mood disorders. </span></p>\n<p><b> </b></p>\n<p><b>Your brain needs nutrients from food:</b></p>\n<p><span>Your brain needs omega-3 fatty acids for proper functioning. However, our bodies do not naturally produce omega-3s, and we must add them to our diet. Additionally, many people who do not consume nearly enough omega-3 fatty acids instead look to supplement their daily vitamin intake with omega-3 capsules.</span></p>\n<p><span>Instead of another daily supplement, add fun, new, </span><i><span>delicious</span></i><span> dishes to your weekly rotation!</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span>Day Boat Sea </span><a href=\"https://pacificcloudseafoods.com/search?type=product%2Cpage%2Carticle&amp;q=scallop\"><span>Scallops</span></a><span> and Side-Stripe </span><a href=\"https://pacificcloudseafoods.com/search?q=shrimp\"><span>Shrimp</span></a><span> are great, low-caloric sources of lean protein. </span>\n</li>\n<li><span>A standard serving size for each would be about 3 oz, consumed three times a week. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b><span>Important Nutrients:</span><br></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Scallops contain 333mg omegas, 50.4mg magnesium, zinc, and B12. </span></li>\n<li><span>Shrimp contain 267mg omegas, 33.2mg magnesium, zinc, and iron. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Both </span><b>zinc</b><span> and </span><b>magnesium</b><span> are essential trace elements for anti-inflammation and brain function. </span><b>Vitamin B12</b><span> may benefit your body in impressive ways, such as by boosting energy, improving memory, and helping to prevent heart disease.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<span>A staple, year-round freezer substitute for consuming omega-3 fatty acids would be </span><a href=\"https://pacificcloudseafoods.com/search?q=salmon\"><span>salmon</span></a><span>, especially if you are sensitive to shellfish.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b></b></h2>\n<h3><b>Cooking and Pairing Seafood Tips</b></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://pacificcloudseafoods.com/search?q=shellfish\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Shellfish\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span>Shellfish</span></a><span> pairs nicely with fresh, bright flavors like English peas, celery, spring onions, lemon, and fresh herbs.

Salting them lightly on both sides and letting them hang out while you prep other ingredients will help draw out any moisture and give them that golden, crusty sear you’re looking for. </span></p>\n<p><span>Make sure you give scallops enough room when searing them. Use a large, heavy-bottomed pan and evenly spread heat or cook them in batches. Scallops will be ready to flip when cooked about halfway up and their slightly transparent flesh turns white.</span></p>\n<p><span>I like to sear scallops in healthy cooking oil, such as olive oil, with a touch of butter; it makes the sear and enhances the flavor of the scallops. </span></p>\n<p><span>Scallops can be served on their own with a puree and herb oil or pesto, or you can serve them with rice or couscous, perhaps a risotto!</span></p>\n<p><b> </b></p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><b><span>Endless Ways to Enjoy Shrimp</span>:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pacificcloudseafoods.com/search?q=shrimp\" title=\"Shrimp\"><span>Shrimp</span></a><span> should also have a nice sear. A high heat sauté seals in moisture and gives them beautiful color and texture. Depending on your preference, you can shell them or cook them with the shell on. Cooking with the shell on adds more flavor to broths and simmered dishes. </span></p>\n<p><span>Another key to mastering shrimp is the proper thawing process. The best way to defrost frozen shrimp is to put them in the refrigerator overnight or in a colander, running COLD water over them for 5-10 minutes. This will help you avoid rubbery shrimp. Never use the defrost setting on your microwave!</span></p>\n<p><span>When you are working with whole, wild-caught shrimp, you want to make sure you devein them and remove the digestive tract on the outside by carefully running a paring knife down the back of the shrimp.</span></p>\n<p><span>Shrimp are very versatile, and there are a million ways to use them. Shrimp is excellent in seafood pasta, risotto, stir-fries, and hot or cold salads. </span></p>\n<p><span>I love making fresh Vietnamese summer rolls or dicing them up and using them as a filling for dumplings. I use local, in-season vegetables in my cooking because they taste sweeter after having just been picked, and it is an excellent way to support our local economy. </span></p>\n<p><span>Imagine shrimp on a bed of sauteed leeks, garlic, and peas – accompanied by homemade potato gnocchi! </span></p>\n<h3><b>Shop Local!</b></h3>\n<p>Having a trusted local seafood supplier such as Pacific Cloud Seafoods makes obtaining a variety of in-season, wild-caught seafood a part of your weekly routine simple.

      "content": "<p>The mission of Pacific Cloud Seafoods has always been: bring the best sourced seafood to consumers who Value it. <br><br>There is a lot to unpack there and I want this blog post to shed light on is what that means starting with \"Best Sourced\". To Us it means seafood that is harvested in a way that minimizes the impact to the resource over-all. My personal Experience and research has led me to source from small boats, Co-ops, and processors who support those businesses. <br><br>Generally that includes community based businesses but ocassionally multi-national business with aligned values will check the boxes as well. For instance Canada, our close neighbor has the same struggles as we do but they handle it differently.<br><br>The other part that matters to us when we say \"best Sourced\" is the part about what drives the business. Our Goal is to exist. To pay our harvesters, partners and Employees a living wage. That does not always translate into the cheapest seafood in town. Very often it results in a higher price.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In order to hit our goals one of the new things we intend to invest in is the storytelling and communication with our consumers and producers. </p>",

They've been my companions in solitude, my teachers in the quest for knowledge, and my windows into the minds of others. Through books, I've lived a thousand lives, visited places I've never been, and expanded my understanding of the world. They have served as a refuge during difficult times and a source of joy during periods of happiness. This post will delve into my top 10 favorite books, each one having left an indelible impact on me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"e0ff9677-ac4f-45ab-a0d7-969233e6a805\" class=\"\">\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee</h2>\n<p id=\"1d753ecd-3693-4347-bdcb-1a7a86c07dd8\" class=\"\">To Kill a Mockingbird is a timeless classic that never fails to move me. It's a beautifully written tale of innocence, courage, and the struggle against injustice. Harper Lee paints a vivid picture of the racial tension in the deep south during the 1930s. This book is not just about racial inequality; it's also a profound study of human nature, about understanding people by stepping into their shoes. This lesson has resonated deeply with me and influenced my perspective on empathy and understanding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ccbabae4-a119-4a50-a12f-2d2fc736f8f8\" class=\"\">\"1984\" by George Orwell</h2>\n<p id=\"03569f7a-1761-4a65-8405-eac60ca7ba47\" class=\"\">1984 is a chilling prophecy about the future that has left an indelible print on my mind. George Orwell's depiction of a dystopian society where surveillance and propaganda are rampant is a stark warning about the loss of individuality and freedom. This dystopian novel is not just a work of fiction; it's a mirror held up to humanity, reflecting our darkest fears about power, control, and loss of freedom. This book has made me value my rights as an individual and appreciate the democracy we often take for granted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4c09b4c0-5e54-4705-b33d-eb4e65508419\" class=\"\">\"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen</h2>\n<p id=\"ff41518e-9fcd-4f0b-ae00-bdb3e1575359\" class=\"\">Pride and Prejudice is a timeless romance novel that I absolutely adore. Jane Austen's wit, character development, and exploration of societal norms in the 19th-century England are nothing short of brilliant. The story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy is not just a love story; it's a narrative about overcoming personal flaws, societal pressure, and the importance of understanding and overcoming one's prejudices. It's a tale that has taught me about the importance of self-awareness and personal growth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"f0ccd618-4885-4ce1-8b8b-09ac37246484\" class=\"\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p id=\"00893778-7f4b-4235-9a91-1fdfff5f0b66\" class=\"\">The books I've mentioned are just three of my top 10 favorites that have shaped my life in one way or another. Each one of them has had a different impact, teaching me valuable lessons about life, society, and human nature. They've not only entertained me but also broadened my perspectives, ignited my imagination, and taught me to appreciate the complexity of the world we live in. I hope you find them as enlightening and enjoyable as I do and perhaps they might inspire you to explore new genres, authors, or themes in literature.</p>\n</div><span class=\"sans\" style=\"font-size:14px;padding-top:2em\"></span>",

Those who qualify can be fishermen, boats, corporations—the design varies. It takes some history in the industry to get a piece. But once those rights are awarded by the government, whoever holds that slice of the pie holds exclusive access to a corresponding percentage of fish. Those rights are privately controlled after that. By law, the government can take them back at any time. But it hasn’t.

They are a type of fishing management system that became national policy in the United States in 2010 to encourage sustainable fishing.

A lot of them, really. They limit the amount of fish that can be caught, allowing depleted populations make a comeback. They reduce the number of boats pillaging the seas and make fishing safer just by thinning competition. Catch shares mean nobody rushes to the sea in a hurricane to get an edge on the next guy. Not only is that good for the ocean, it saves lives. It’s also intended to boost values for seafood, a potential windfall for fishermen. </p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; line-height: 1.5; margin: 0px 0px 1.2em; font-family: Retina,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 19px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Catch shares have opened up markets for the sale and lease of access rights to fishing like nothing we have ever seen. The hope from the environmental camp was that these rights would live with fishermen and be passed from one generation to the next, giving them a greater stake in the health of the ocean and making them better stewards. It was a noble and worthwhile vision. It just isn’t what’s happened, at least not very much. In reality, these rights are worth so much money that rich investors snap them up at top prices, making it tough for people who actually fish to acquire them.

In what was blandly dubbed the Individual Fishing Quota Halibut and Sablefish Program?or IFQ for short?the feds sized up the fishery, diced it up into pieces like pie, and gave boat owners with a history of fishing it a slice. Those slices are today worth a combined $245 million, and many of the people who received them became, quite literally, instant millionaires. Their wealth is derived from a simple shift of ownership from the public trust to them, accomplished, after years of meetings, with a stack of paper and a few brisk pen strokes. It was a move that created basic inequities in a system that has yet to right itself.</span></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 1rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 1.063rem; line-height: 1.75rem; max-width: 640px; color: #292929; font-family: Merriweather,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Roboto,Arial,sans-serif;\">Those owners, the ones who were gifted the shares at the outset of the program’s launch, own that fish now?or, more specifically, they own the rights to catch a certain amount each year. The program is designed to make them eventually sell that quota as they get older and stop fishing. And it’s intended to land those shares in the hands of young fishermen, as no one is supposed to be able to purchase quota unless they can prove 150 days or more of commercial fishing experience. But the sad truth is that few of those initial quota holders let go of their shares. They’re too valuable an asset to sell. And for the next generation?who have to buy quota rather than receive it from the government?catch shares are expensive, an investment on par with buying real estate in a volatile market.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 1rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 1.063rem; line-height: 1.75rem; max-width: 640px; color: #292929; font-family: Merriweather,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Roboto,Arial,sans-serif;\">The result is that about half the halibut caught in 2011 was dragged out of the sea by guys who leased quota from these owners. Legally, the first generation of quota owners are allowed to hire a skipper, like Painter or Bright, and lease them the right to fish for their shares. That means whenever Painter and Bright go fishing, they not only provide the boat, pay the crew, and take the risk on the sea?they also pay rent to their fishing landlords, who sit at home and collect a check.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 1rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 1.063rem; line-height: 1.75rem; max-width: 640px; color: #292929; font-family: Merriweather,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Roboto,Arial,sans-serif;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 1rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 1.063rem; line-height: 1.75rem; max-width: 640px; color: #292929; font-family: Merriweather,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Roboto,Arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"background-color: #fefefe;\">The Environmental Defense Fund, which declined to comment for this story, is the nation’s largest supporter of catch shares, pumping millions into research, lobbying, a catch share design center, and an interactive game meant to teach people about the failures of the fishery management tools of old.

      "content": "<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<div>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><strong>Recipe: Sea Scallop Crudo with Grapefruit, Cherry Tomato, Pickled Red Onion, and Lemon Vinaigrette</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Sea Scallop Crudo is a refreshing and elegant dish that showcases the delicate flavors of fresh scallops. This raw preparation requires the scallops to be of the highest quality and freshness. Paired with vibrant grapefruit, juicy cherry tomatoes, tangy pickled red onion, and a zesty lemon vinaigrette, this recipe is a feast for the senses. Let's dive into the details!</p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>6-8 large fresh sea scallops</li>\n<li>1 ruby red grapefruit, separated into wedges (membrane and pith removed)</li>\n<li>8 orange cherry tomatoes, halved</li>\n<li>1/2 small red onion (sliced very thin)</li>\n<li>Nasturtium and carrot micro greens (optional)</li>\n<li>Juice of 1 fresh lemon</li>\n<li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>\n<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For the vinaigrette:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lemon juice (from 1 fresh lemon)</li>\n<li>Extra virgin olive oil (to match the amount of lemon juice)</li>\n<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Ensure the scallops are as fresh as possible, preferably not more than 48 hours out of the ocean. Talk to your supplier to confirm the scallops' origin and harvest date. Choose day-boat scallops for the best quality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prepare the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice, removing any seeds. Mix in enough olive oil to match the amount of lemon juice. Lightly season with salt and pepper. Add the thinly sliced red onion to the vinaigrette and set it aside for at least 20 minutes to marinate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Arrange the grapefruit wedges, halved cherry tomatoes, micro greens, and vinaigrette around your workstation for quick plating once the scallops are ready.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remove the scallops from the refrigerator. Work quickly to remove the side muscle (a small rectangular tag of flesh attached to the side of each scallop) and rinse the scallops in ice-cold water. Pat dry the scallops thoroughly with paper towels.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Slice the scallops into disks about 1/4 inch thick. Depending on the size of the scallops, you should get 3-4 slices per scallop.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the serving plate, arrange the scallop slices in a staggered line with the grapefruit wedges and cherry tomatoes. Drizzle the lemon vinaigrette over the scallops, grapefruit, and tomatoes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gently garnish with micro greens, such as nasturtium and carrot. This step is optional, and you can use other varieties of micro greens as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Serve the Sea Scallop Crudo immediately for the freshest flavors and textures. Optionally, chill the plates before serving to help preserve the ingredients' freshness.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> For the best results, ensure all the ingredients are of the highest quality and freshness. Discuss with your supplier to obtain the freshest sea scallops, and handle them with care during preparation.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the exquisite combination of flavors in this Sea Scallop Crudo recipe, where the sweetness of scallops meets the tanginess of grapefruit and pickled red onion, all elevated by the zesty lemon vinaigrette. It's a culinary masterpiece that will impress your guests and tantalize their taste buds. Bon appétit!</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\"></div>",
