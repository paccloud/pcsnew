# The Importance of Non-Profits

**Amcc and Nama**

Nonprofit organizations like Amcc and Nama play a vital role in safeguarding the health of our oceans. These organizations are instrumental in raising awareness about environmental issues that often get overlooked amidst greenwashing and corporate propaganda.

As a small boat fisherman, I have leaned on the groundwork both organizations have started in helping to ensure a fair wage for fishers and the working waterfront families who depend on the "blue commons" for their livelihoods. I believe they serve as a beacon for women-led organizations that prioritize making a positive impact while maintaining their integrity.

One of the most significant contributions of these nonprofits is their ability to shine a light on critical issues such as industrial aquaculture, corporate consolidation of public resources, and the rampant waste of billions of pounds of fish every year.

## What Makes These Organizations Vital

### AMCC: Alaska Marine Conservation Council

The Alaska Marine Conservation Council has been a cornerstone of marine conservation and advocacy for sustainable fishing practices in Alaska since 1994. Their approach combines science-based policy, community engagement, and grassroots organizing to create meaningful change.

Key initiatives from AMCC include:

- **Working Waterfronts Program**: Supporting infrastructure and policies that keep coastal communities viable
- **Catch of the Season**: Connecting consumers directly to sustainable Alaska seafood
- **Young Fishermen's Network**: Mentoring and supporting the next generation of community-based fishermen
- **Fisheries Conservation**: Advocating for management that prioritizes ecosystem health and sustainable yields

For small-boat fishermen like myself, AMCC's work is invaluable. They understand that marine conservation isn't just about protecting fish—it's about preserving the cultural and economic fabric of coastal communities that have relied on healthy oceans for generations.

### NAMA: Northwest Atlantic Marine Alliance

NAMA takes a similar community-centered approach on the East Coast, focusing on building capacity for fishing communities to participate in decision-making processes that affect their livelihoods and marine environments.

Their important work includes:

- **Who Fishes Matters Campaign**: Fighting consolidation and privatization of fishing rights
- **Seafood Throwdowns**: Culinary events that educate the public about local, sustainable seafood
- **Community Supported Fisheries**: Pioneering direct marketing approaches that benefit both fishermen and consumers
- **Policy Advocacy**: Engaging fishermen in the regulatory process to ensure their voices are heard

Both organizations understand something crucial about marine conservation: effective solutions must include the people most connected to the resource. Top-down approaches that ignore the knowledge and needs of fishing communities rarely succeed in creating lasting change.

## David vs. Goliath: Taking on Corporate Interests

Perhaps the most courageous aspect of these nonprofits' work is their willingness to challenge powerful corporate interests. While these organizations operate on modest budgets, they're taking on some of the largest seafood corporations and investment firms in the world.

They've been at the forefront of exposing problems like:

- **Catch Shares Privatization**: The transformation of public fishery resources into tradable commodities that increasingly benefit investors rather than fishing communities
- **Offshore Aquaculture Expansion**: The push to industrialize ocean spaces with massive fish farming operations that can pollute surrounding waters
- **Monitoring Shortcuts**: Inadequate observation and accountability in industrial fishing operations
- **Resource Concentration**: The growing control of fishing rights by fewer and larger entities

Through research, education, and advocacy, these nonprofits create space for public discourse on these issues that might otherwise be shaped entirely by corporate messaging and lobbying.

## Women-Led Change in a Traditionally Male Industry

It's worth noting that both AMCC and NAMA have been led primarily by women, bringing important perspective and leadership approaches to an industry historically dominated by men. This leadership has helped broaden the conversation about fisheries beyond simple economics to include social justice, food system resilience, and community wellbeing.

Their collaborative approach has created powerful coalitions that bring together diverse stakeholders—fishermen, scientists, indigenous communities, and concerned citizens—around shared values of ocean health and community sustainability.

## Through their advocacy, education, and outreach efforts, these organizations are creating a more informed and engaged public that is better equipped to address the environmental challenges facing our oceans. As individuals, we can support these nonprofits by spreading the word about their work, making donations, and volunteering our time and resources to their cause.

We need more organizations like Amcc and Nama to safeguard our oceans and promote a sustainable future for our planet. Their work is essential, and we must support their efforts to ensure that our oceans remain healthy and vibrant for generations to come.
