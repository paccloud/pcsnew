# Happy New Year! 2023 in Review. We're Moving in 2024!!!

Well 2023 came and went. Although we had a lot of changes, in some ways things stayed the same.

## In Alaska:
In our fishing world: Alaska, there were some major shakeups which rocked the core of many of our partners. For one: the largest buyer of seafood in North America, Trident Seafoods, announced they would be selling 1/3 of their Alaska Operations. For the people of Kodiak, that came as a huge surprise considering a very aggressive acquisition campaign over the last 20 or so years that included buying some of the other, long-term Kodiak fixtures like the "King Crab Cannery" (Western Seafoods, every plant is known by the locals by another name or two. Sometimes boats and especially fishermen have multiple names).

I had the opportunity to fish in some parts of the State that I have spent time in, but never actually fished. The most striking was the southeast town of Sitka. We actually got away from town and circumvented Baranof island and delivered one load of King Salmon to the town of Hoonah, AK. I felt like I could spend many years in that beautiful part of earth and completely understand why people do. The captain of the F/V Aljac is 76 years old and was running circles around me on deck. I was impressed at how fast and thorough he was at cleaning salmon.

Fishermen are resilient however, and the story of Trident started when a young Chuck Bundrant came to Alaska from Indiana and fished with some local Kodiak shrimpers, the Burtch Brothers. Complaining about the price paid to fishermen by the then-large processors, Chuck teamed up with another fisherman and decided to start their own processing business. That spirit of innovation and determination continues today among the fishing communities of Alaska, who are always looking for ways to adapt and thrive despite industry challenges.

## IN BUFFALO:

We are excited to announce our new manufacturing facility/retail space located at 930 Clinton Ave (near the Clinton/Bailey Farmers Market). We will be sharing a space with Fresh Fix who we already partner with for distribution.

We are focused this year on increasing opportunities for harvesters like us to direct market their catch. We launched our web-development/software arm of the company and will be launching sites for our friends who need help getting a store up and running. We are also distributing to more stores locally so if you are a chef, store or someone who would like to purchase larger quantities of our fish at wholesale, please send us a note here.

Manufacturing of burgers, fish skin animal treats, and other ancillary products will help us reach a scale of operation that maximizes both efficiency and quality. By developing these value-added products, we're able to utilize more of each fish and reduce waste while creating additional revenue streams that support our core mission.

If we increase our volume, we can save money on shipping and help reduce the impact that industry consolidation is having on the communities in Alaska. We also will be hiring more folks to increase this production locally, creating jobs and strengthening Buffalo's local food economy.

## Looking Ahead to 2024

The move to our new Clinton Ave location represents more than just a change of addressâ€”it's a significant expansion of our capacity and capabilities. With more space for processing, inventory, and retail, we'll be able to serve more customers while maintaining the quality and personal touch that defines Pacific Cloud Seafoods.

We're particularly excited about deepening our partnership with Fresh Fix, which will allow both businesses to leverage shared resources while maintaining our distinct identities and missions. This collaboration model reflects our belief in community-based business and the power of local food systems.

As we grow, we remain committed to our founding principles:
- Supporting small-scale, sustainable fishing operations
- Providing exceptional quality seafood
- Creating direct connections between harvesters and consumers
- Building resilient, community-based food systems

Thank you to all our customers, partners, and supporters who made 2023 a success despite its challenges. We look forward to serving you from our new location in 2024 and continuing to bring the best of Alaska's waters to Buffalo's tables.

Stay tuned for details about our grand opening celebration at the new space!
