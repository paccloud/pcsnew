# Alaska Salmon Season 2023: My Journey Through Sitka, Homer, and Kodiak

Sitka, Homer and Kodiak. Those were the ports I visited this time around. Usually when I said I was "going fishing," I was referring to my 19-year tenure in western Alaska, most notably, Kodiak.

But 2023 brought me to new waters and new experiences, expanding my perspective on Alaska's diverse salmon fisheries and deepening my appreciation for this remarkable fish and the people who harvest it.

## Sitka: Southeast Splendor

My first stop was Sitka, nestled on Baranof Island in Alaska's southeast panhandle. Known for its breathtaking scenery—towering spruce trees meeting pristine waters with snow-capped mountains in the background—Sitka's beauty is matched only by the quality of its salmon.

The fishing operation here differed considerably from what I was accustomed to in Kodiak. The smaller boats, typically 38-58 feet, are perfect for navigating the protected waters of the Inside Passage. Many are family operations, with knowledge passed down through generations.

I worked aboard the F/V Northern Dream, a 42-foot troller. Unlike the seine nets used in much of Alaska, trolling involves multiple lines with hooks dragged through the water, allowing for selective harvesting. Each salmon is individually caught and immediately processed—bled, gutted, and placed on ice. This meticulous handling results in some of the highest quality fish I've ever seen.

What struck me most was the deep connection these fishermen have to their territory. They know every cove, every current, and exactly where different salmon species are likely to be running at any given time. This isn't just fishing; it's a relationship with the ocean that's been cultivated over decades.

## Homer: The Halibut Capital Meets Salmon

Next, I traveled to Homer on the Kenai Peninsula. While famous for its halibut fishery, Homer also hosts a vibrant salmon fleet. Here, I experienced the sockeye (red) salmon run in Cook Inlet.

The waters of Cook Inlet present unique challenges—powerful tides, dangerous rips, and the occasional encounter with a massive tanker heading to Anchorage. Despite these obstacles, the fleet works with remarkable efficiency, bringing in thousands of bright red sockeye each day during the peak season.

I joined the crew of the F/V North Star, a 32-foot drift gillnetter. The operation was intensely physical—setting and retrieving nets, picking fish, and managing the deck in sometimes challenging conditions. But the reward was worth it: chrome-bright sockeye, their skin gleaming like polished silver with just a hint of that distinctive red beginning to show through.

What makes Homer unique is its accessibility. Unlike the remote ports of Western Alaska, Homer connects directly to the road system, allowing for more immediate processing and distribution. Some fishermen even sell part of their catch directly to local restaurants and markets, creating a farm-to-table (or sea-to-table) economy that benefits the entire community.

## Kodiak: Coming Home

Finally, I returned to Kodiak, the island I've called my fishing home for nearly two decades. Despite having fished here for so many years, Kodiak never ceases to surprise me with its wild beauty and abundant marine life.

This season, I rejoined the crew of the F/V Pacific Cloud, a 58-foot seiner that has weathered countless storms and brought in millions of pounds of salmon over her lifetime. Seining is a dance between boat, net, and fish—requiring coordination, timing, and an intuitive understanding of how salmon move through the water.

Kodiak's 2023 salmon season was marked by contrasts. Some districts saw record returns, while others struggled. Climate change continues to alter run timing and abundance, creating new challenges for fisheries management and for those of us trying to make a living on the water.

What remains constant, however, is the community. Kodiak's fishing fleet is diverse—Alaskan Natives whose ancestors have fished these waters for thousands of years, Norwegian immigrants who brought their seafaring traditions across the ocean, and newcomers drawn by the promise of adventure and prosperity. Despite our differences, we share a common bond: respect for the salmon that sustains us and for the ocean that makes it all possible.

## Reflections on the 2023 Season

As I look back on my journey through these three distinct fishing communities, I'm struck by both the differences and the commonalities. Each port has its own character, shaped by geography, history, and the specific challenges of its fishery. Yet all share a fundamental commitment to sustainability and quality.

The 2023 season reinforced my belief in the importance of preserving Alaska's small-boat fishing fleet. These aren't just businesses; they're cultural institutions that maintain traditional knowledge while adapting to changing conditions. They're also critical economic engines for coastal communities that would otherwise have few opportunities.

At Pacific Cloud Seafoods, we're proud to bring the fruits of this labor directly to your table. When you purchase our wild Alaska salmon, you're not just buying a meal—you're participating in a tradition that stretches back generations and supporting a way of life that embodies the best of what Alaska has to offer.

Here's to the 2023 salmon season, to the hardworking men and women who made it possible, and to the magnificent fish that continues to inspire and sustain us all.
