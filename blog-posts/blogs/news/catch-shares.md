# Catch Shares: The Privatization of America's Ocean Commons

## What Are Catch Shares?

Catch shares are a type of fishing management system that became national policy in the United States in 2010 to encourage sustainable fishing. They deploy caps on the amount of fish that can be caught, then dole out the rights to fish them among qualifying entities. Those who qualify can be fishermen, boats, corporations—the design varies. It takes some history in the industry to get a piece. But once those rights are awarded by the government, whoever holds that slice of the pie holds exclusive access to a corresponding percentage of fish. 

Those rights are privately controlled after that. By law, the government can take them back at any time. But it hasn't. Every catch share in America has remained steadily in private hands since 1992.

## The Benefits: Conservation and Safety

Catch shares have some perks. A lot of them, really. They limit the amount of fish that can be caught, allowing depleted populations to make a comeback. They reduce the number of boats pillaging the seas and make fishing safer just by thinning competition. Catch shares mean nobody rushes to the sea in a hurricane to get an edge on the next guy. Not only is that good for the ocean, it saves lives. It's also intended to boost values for seafood, a potential windfall for fishermen.

These positive aspects of catch shares have been heavily promoted by environmental organizations like the Environmental Defense Fund, which has invested millions in research, lobbying, and promotion of these programs. Their vision was that fishermen with ownership rights would naturally become better stewards of the resource.

## The Hidden Costs: Consolidation and Communities

Despite these advantages, catch shares have opened up markets for the sale and lease of access rights to fishing like nothing we have ever seen. The hope from the environmental camp was that these rights would live with fishermen and be passed from one generation to the next, giving them a greater stake in the health of the ocean. It was a noble and worthwhile vision. It just isn't what's happened, at least not very much.

In reality, these rights are worth so much money that wealthy investors snap them up at top prices, making it tough for people who actually fish to acquire them. Consider the present cost of halibut rights, which in prime fishing areas fetch upward of $40 a pound. That's about six times the best dock price a fisherman can earn for delivering the same fish.

The result is that about half the halibut caught in recent years was dragged out of the sea by fishermen who leased quota from these owners. Legally, the first generation of quota owners are allowed to hire a skipper and lease them the right to fish for their shares. That means whenever these working fishermen go fishing, they not only provide the boat, pay the crew, and take the risk on the sea—they also pay rent to their fishing landlords, who sit at home and collect a check.

## The Broken Promises

Policymakers assured the nation that fishing rights would never migrate out of U.S. control through catch shares or end up as properties of investment firms. Environmental groups have similarly touted catch shares as a tool for communities and fishermen and overlooked the role investors can and do play.

Federal law does prohibit ownership of fish access for investment purposes. But it's like a prohibition on jaywalking: quaint and rarely enforced. The same goes for foreign acquisition of U.S. fishing rights, which is similarly banned by federal law. But there's a loophole: Firms can acquire American-owned corporations or hang a shingle on American soil and qualify for ownership as long as the CEO of the U.S. corporation is an American, along with most of its board.

## The Human Impact

The federal program intended to make halibut and black cod more valuable, safer to fish, and spare it from inevitable extinction had taken hold. In what was blandly dubbed the Individual Fishing Quota Halibut and Sablefish Program—or IFQ for short—the feds sized up the fishery, diced it up into pieces like pie, and gave boat owners with a history of fishing it a slice. Those slices are today worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and many of the people who received them became, quite literally, instant millionaires. Their wealth is derived from a simple shift of ownership from the public trust to them, accomplished, after years of meetings, with a stack of paper and a few brisk pen strokes. It was a move that created basic inequities in a system that has yet to right itself.

The private property rights attending catch shares had locked many fishermen and even whole communities out of the oceans. Catch shares were converting fishermen from proud family-business sorts into sharecroppers who were leasing their access to the sea from wealthy and increasingly corporate power brokers.

## Looking Forward: Alternative Approaches

At Pacific Cloud Seafoods, we believe in a different model—one that keeps fishing rights in the hands of active fishermen and provides fair compensation for their work and investment. We support:

1. **Community Quota Entities (CQEs)** that allow fishing communities to collectively hold quota
2. **Owner-operator requirements** that ensure those who own quota actually fish it
3. **Limits on quota consolidation** to prevent excessive concentration of fishing rights
4. **Direct marketing opportunities** that help fishermen receive full value for their catch

By connecting consumers directly with small-boat fishermen, we're working to create a more equitable seafood system that preserves traditional fishing communities while also ensuring sustainable harvests for future generations.

The catch share system isn't going away anytime soon, but with informed consumers making conscious seafood choices, we can help ensure that the benefits of our ocean resources are more widely and fairly distributed.
