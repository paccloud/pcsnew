# Whitefish: The Humble Heart of Pacific Cloud Seafoods

Pacific Cloud Seafoods started when I went to Alaska and discovered the pure joy of Cod and Rockfish Jigging. I fell in love with the insignificant impact on the ecosystem as well as the quality of the proteins presented to our customers. In this case it was a Five star chef who moved to Kodiak and had his own little coffee/sandwich shop. Chef Jouelle purchased my first commercially landed harvest of Cod, Black and Dusky Rockfish from the F/V Shearwater.

## The Magic of Jigging

There's something almost meditative about jigging for cod and rockfish. Unlike the industrial trawling operations that can damage seafloor habitats or the long, grueling days of salmon seining, jigging is quiet, selective, and gentle on both the environment and the fish themselves.

When you're jigging, you lower a series of hooks on a weighted line into the water, creating a motion that mimics injured prey. This allows you to target specific species with minimal bycatch, and because each fish is brought up individually, they can be handled with exceptional care from the moment they leave the water.

This method produces fish of remarkable quality. Without the crushing pressure of nets or the stress of long periods spent hooked on a line, jig-caught fish are in pristine condition when they reach the boat. Each one can be immediately bled, gutted, and iced to preserve its flavor and texture.

## The Unsung Heroes of the Sea

While salmon and halibut get most of the glory in Alaskan seafood, whitefish species like cod and rockfish have always been the backbone of coastal communities. These fish are abundant, versatile, and delicious—yet often overlooked by consumers who haven't experienced their true potential.

Pacific cod, with its firm, flaky texture and mild, slightly sweet taste, is incredibly versatile in the kitchen. It holds up well to bold flavors while still letting its natural qualities shine through. Whether baked, broiled, fried, or used in chowders and stews, cod delivers consistent results that even finicky eaters enjoy.

Rockfish, meanwhile, offers a firmer texture and often a slightly sweeter profile than cod. The various species—including black rockfish, dusky rockfish, and yelloweye—each have subtle flavor differences that chefs love to explore. The relatively high oil content in rockfish makes it forgiving to cook, staying moist and tender even when subjected to high heat.

## Sustainability in Action

What many people don't realize is that these whitefish species represent some of the most sustainable seafood choices available. Alaska's fishery management system is among the most rigorous in the world, with strict quotas and gear restrictions that ensure healthy populations.

Jig fishing takes this sustainability one step further by virtually eliminating bycatch and habitat damage. When I'm jigging, I can release any undersized fish or non-target species with minimal stress, ensuring they can swim away unharmed.

As climate change and overfishing threaten seafood resources worldwide, these carefully managed Alaskan whitefish fisheries stand as a model of what's possible when conservation and commerce work together.

## From Boat to Plate: A Journey of Quality

At Pacific Cloud Seafoods, we've built our reputation on bringing this exceptional quality directly to consumers. Each piece of cod or rockfish we sell follows a carefully monitored journey from the moment it's caught:

1. Fish are individually landed, immediately bled, and gutted on the boat
2. They're thoroughly cleaned and immediately placed in ice slurry
3. At the processing facility, they're filleted by skilled hands rather than mechanical equipment
4. The fillets are quickly frozen at ultra-low temperatures to lock in freshness
5. They're stored at precise temperatures during transport
6. They reach your table in the same pristine condition they were in moments after leaving the ocean

This attention to detail matters. Many customers who claim they "don't like fish" or find it "too fishy" have simply never experienced properly handled seafood. When they try our whitefish products, the reaction is often one of surprise—"I didn't know fish could taste like this!"

## Looking Forward

As Pacific Cloud Seafoods has grown, we've remained true to these roots. While we've expanded our offerings to include a variety of seafood products, cod and rockfish jigging remains at the heart of what we do and who we are.

We're proud to support the small-boat fishermen who practice these sustainable fishing methods, and we're grateful for customers who recognize and value the difference in quality and environmental impact.

The next time you're considering what seafood to serve, we hope you'll give these humble whitefish species a chance to shine on your table. They may not have the glamorous reputation of some other seafood options, but their versatility, sustainability, and clean, delicious flavor make them true stars in the kitchen—and an important part of Alaska's fishing future.
