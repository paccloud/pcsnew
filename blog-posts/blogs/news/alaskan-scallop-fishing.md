# Alaskan Scallop Fishing: Life Aboard the F/V Kilkenny

Scallop fishing on the F/V Kilkenny represents one of Alaska's smallest yet most specialized fisheries. Having spent time aboard this vessel, I gained unique insights into a world few people ever witness—the challenging and precise work of harvesting wild weathervane scallops from the ocean floor.

## A Specialized Fishery

Alaska's scallop fishery is remarkably small—just a handful of vessels participate, with the F/V Kilkenny being one of the primary harvesters. These specialized boats target weathervane scallops (Patinopecten caurinus), the largest scallop species in the world, which can grow up to 12 inches in diameter.

Unlike many fisheries where hundreds or thousands of participants compete, the scallop fleet operates under a cooperative system with strict limits. This controlled approach, combined with careful monitoring, has helped maintain the fishery's sustainability for decades.

## Life Aboard a Scallop Vessel

The F/V Kilkenny is essentially a floating scallop processing plant. At 124 feet long, it accommodates a crew of about 12-14 people who work in shifts around the clock during the fishing season. The vessel typically stays at sea for 15-20 days at a stretch, during which time the crew harvests, processes, and freezes scallops continuously.

The daily routine is structured around four-hour watches. When on watch, crew members rotate through different stations:
- Operating the dredges that collect scallops from the seafloor
- Sorting the catch on deck, separating scallops from bycatch
- Shucking scallops in the processing area
- Cleaning and packaging the meat
- Freezing the final product

This work continues 24 hours a day, with crew members alternating between four hours on duty and eight hours off. During those precious off hours, crew members eat, sleep, and perhaps watch a movie or read before returning to their stations.

## The Harvest Method

Scallops are harvested using specialized dredges—metal frames with attached bags made of steel rings. The F/V Kilkenny tows two dredges simultaneously, each about 15 feet wide, at very slow speeds (1-2 knots) across the ocean floor where scallops live.

When the dredges are hauled back aboard, they contain not only scallops but also crabs, fish, starfish, and other ocean floor inhabitants. Crew members quickly sort through this material on deck, returning non-target species to the sea while collecting the scallops for processing.

An observer from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game is present for all fishing operations, monitoring the catch composition and ensuring compliance with strict bycatch limits. If too many crabs or other protected species are caught, fishing must move to a different area.

## The Art of Shucking

Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of scallop fishing is the shucking process. Unlike many seafood operations that have become increasingly mechanized, scallop shucking remains a skilled manual task.

In the processing area below deck, shuckers stand at stainless steel tables with specially designed knives. With remarkable speed and precision, they:
1. Open each scallop shell with a specialized tool
2. Separate the adductor muscle (the part we eat) from the rest of the animal
3. Remove the muscle and clean away any attached membrane
4. Place the cleaned "scallop meat" in a colander for rinsing

A skilled shucker can process hundreds of scallops per hour, with the entire crew collectively processing thousands of pounds during a typical trip. The meat is then rinsed, graded by size, packaged, and blast-frozen at sea to preserve maximum freshness.

## Sustainability Practices

What impressed me most during my time on the F/V Kilkenny was the crew's commitment to responsible harvesting. The Alaska scallop fishery employs several key sustainability measures:

- **Rotational closures**: Different scallop beds are fished in alternating years, allowing recovery time
- **Limited entry**: Only a few vessels are permitted to participate
- **100% observer coverage**: Independent scientists monitor every fishing operation
- **Strict bycatch limits**: If too many crabs or other species are caught, the vessel must move
- **Real-time data collection**: Detailed records are kept of all fishing activity and catch composition

These measures have helped maintain the fishery's sustainability for over forty years, proving that with proper management, wild seafood can be harvested responsibly for generations.

## From Sea to Plate

The scallops harvested by the F/V Kilkenny are among the finest seafood products in the world. After being processed and frozen at sea, they're delivered to port where they're typically sold to high-end restaurants and premium seafood retailers.

When you enjoy an Alaskan weathervane scallop from Pacific Cloud Seafoods, you're tasting the results of this remarkable operation—a perfect intersection of traditional fishing skills, modern conservation practices, and the incredible natural bounty of Alaska's waters.

Each scallop represents not just a delicious meal, but the work of the dedicated crew members who brave challenging conditions to bring this sustainable delicacy from the ocean floor to your table.
