# Alaska's Real Deadliest Catch

Commercial diving claims more lives annually than all the fisheries of the United States combined. A diver in Kodiak, Alaska took his last breath while under his fishing vessel, the F/V Pacific Cloud. Stefan Horwath, known locally as "Little Steve," was one of many who have faced the ultimate risk in what may truly be Alaska's deadliest catch.

## The Hidden Dangers Below the Surface

When people think about dangerous Alaskan fishing jobs, they often picture crab fishermen battling massive waves in the Bering Sea, their struggles dramatized on reality television. What remains largely untold is the story of commercial divers who work in near-freezing waters, often with limited visibility, to maintain and repair vessels or harvest seafood from the ocean floor.

These divers face a multitude of hazards that most fishermen don't:
- Water temperatures that can cause hypothermia within minutes
- Dangerous currents that can sweep divers away from safety
- Equipment failures in remote locations
- Extreme pressure at depth that can cause decompression sickness
- Entanglement risks from fishing gear and kelp
- Limited visibility in murky waters
- Wildlife encounters including sea lions and sharks

## Little Steve's Story

Stefan "Little Steve" Horwath was a respected diver in the Kodiak community, known for his skill and caution when working beneath the waves. With over 15 years of diving experience, he had developed a reputation as someone who could solve nearly any underwater problem a vessel might face.

On that fateful day, Steve was performing routine maintenance on the F/V Pacific Cloud, checking the propeller and rudder systems before the vessel's departure for the upcoming fishing season. What should have been a standard dive turned tragic when his air supply was compromised. Despite immediate rescue efforts from the crew, Steve couldn't be revived.

His loss sent ripples through the tight-knit Kodiak maritime community, reminding everyone of the risks taken by those who support Alaska's fishing industry beneath the surface.

## The Statistics Tell the Story

According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), commercial diving fatalities occur at a rate significantly higher than commercial fishing deaths, yet receive far less attention. Between 2011 and 2021:

- Commercial diving had a fatality rate of approximately 25 deaths per 1,000 full-time equivalent workers
- By comparison, commercial fishing had a rate of about 12 deaths per 1,000 FTE workers

These numbers reveal the stark reality: while fishing is certainly dangerous, commercial diving is more than twice as deadly, making it the true "deadliest catch" of Alaskan waters.

## Improving Safety Standards

In the wake of tragedies like Steve's, the commercial diving industry has worked to implement stronger safety protocols:

- Requiring standby divers to be ready for immediate rescue
- Improving communication systems between divers and surface support
- Establishing more rigorous equipment maintenance schedules
- Implementing longer training periods for new divers
- Creating stricter weather and condition limitations for dive operations

While these measures have helped reduce incidents, commercial diving remains inherently dangerous, especially in Alaska's challenging environment.

## Honoring Those Lost

For the families of divers like Steve Horwath, there's a bittersweet pride in knowing their loved ones contributed to an essential yet dangerous industry. Their sacrifice helps keep Alaska's fishing fleet operational and supports the livelihoods of countless fishermen and processing workers.

At Pacific Cloud Seafoods, we remember Steve's contribution to the maritime industry and honor all those who face extraordinary risks to bring sustainable seafood to our tables. The next time you enjoy wild-caught Alaskan seafood, take a moment to appreciate not just the fishermen who caught it, but the divers who help make those catches possible.

Their story may not be featured on reality television, but it deserves to be told.
