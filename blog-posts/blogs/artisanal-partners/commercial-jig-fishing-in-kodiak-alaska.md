The word "commercial" sometimes gets confused or misinterpreted to mean industrial, or large-scale. It simply means to sell for a profit. 

At Pacific Cloud Seafoods, we're proud to represent a different kind of commercial fishing—one that prioritizes sustainability, quality, and community over volume and efficiency at all costs.

## What is Jig Fishing?

Jig fishing is one of the most selective and environmentally friendly methods of harvesting fish. Using a series of hooks attached to a weighted line, jig fishermen target specific species while minimizing bycatch and habitat impact. In Kodiak, Alaska, this method has been perfected over generations to harvest cod, rockfish, and other groundfish species.

The process is both simple and skillful:

1. A hydraulic or electric jig machine lowers baited hooks to the ocean floor
2. The machine creates a jigging motion that mimics injured prey
3. Target fish are attracted to the movement and take the bait
4. Fish are brought up individually or in small numbers
5. Non-target species can be released with minimal stress or injury

Unlike trawling, which can damage seafloor habitats, or longlines that may sit for hours catching whatever swims by, jigging allows for immediate sorting and release of any unintended catch.

## Small Boats, Big Impact

Kodiak's jig fleet primarily consists of vessels under 58 feet, often operated by owner-captains who live in the communities they fish from. These small boats have a dramatically smaller carbon footprint than the industrial trawl fleet, using a fraction of the fuel while producing superior quality fish.

What makes Kodiak's jig fleet special:

- **Community connection**: Most jig boats are locally owned and operated
- **Selective harvesting**: Minimal bycatch and virtually no habitat impact
- **Superior product**: Fish are handled individually, ensuring better quality
- **Lower carbon footprint**: Small vessels use significantly less fuel
- **Economic distribution**: Profits stay in coastal communities rather than going to corporate shareholders

## A Day on a Kodiak Jig Boat

Life aboard a jig boat is both demanding and rewarding. Unlike the multi-week trips of larger vessels, jig boats typically fish day trips, allowing for fresher deliveries and more sustainable work schedules for the crew.

A typical day starts before dawn, with the captain checking weather conditions and plotting the day's fishing strategy. Once on the fishing grounds, the crew deploys the jig machines, carefully monitoring the catch to ensure they're targeting the right species and size.

Each fish is handled individually—cleaned, bled, and iced to preserve its quality. This attention to detail means jig-caught fish typically command premium prices in the marketplace, benefiting both the fishermen and the consumers who get to enjoy superior seafood.

## Challenges Facing Kodiak's Jig Fleet

Despite the environmental and quality advantages, Kodiak's jig fleet faces significant challenges:

- **Quota allocation**: Larger industrial vessels often receive disproportionate shares of the available catch
- **Changing ocean conditions**: Climate change impacts fish migration and availability
- **Market consolidation**: Processing facilities increasingly focused on volume rather than quality
- **Generational transition**: High entry costs make it difficult for young fishermen to join the fleet

These challenges make direct marketing efforts like Pacific Cloud Seafoods all the more critical—by connecting conscientious consumers directly with sustainable fishermen, we help preserve this traditional fishing method.
