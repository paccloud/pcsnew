# Progress

## What Works
- Basic WordPress installation
- Child theme created and active
- Local development environment set up
- Identified root cause of recipes page error

## Current Issues
- 502 server error on entire Local site
- Need to restart Local by Flywheel
- Recipes page template conflict resolved (archive-recipe.php removed)

## Recent Fixes
- Removed problematic archive-recipe.php that was using undefined `block_template_part()` function
- Created backup of original template
- Set up for default archive template usage

## What's Left to Build
- Verify recipes page works after Local restart
- Style recipes page with CSS if needed
- Recipe filtering system (already in plugin, needs testing)
- Integration with product pages
- Proper block theme template for recipes (optional)

## Status
- Server error blocking progress
- Template conflict identified and fixed
- Ready to test once Local site is restarted

## #layout Tag
- 502 error was caused by undefined function in child theme template
- Solution: removed custom archive-recipe.php template
- Will use parent theme's default archive template
