# Active Context

## Current Task
Fixing the recipes page display issue in the PCS Twenty Twenty-Five child theme

## Environment
- Local development: ~/Local Sites/pcsnew/app/public
- Child theme: wp-content/themes/pcs-twentytwentyfive-child
- Parent theme: Twenty Twenty-Five
- Local URL: http://pacific-cloud-seafood.local/

## Recent Changes
- Removed problematic archive-recipe.php from child theme
- Created backup as archive-recipe.php.backup
- Issue was `block_template_part()` undefined function

## Current Issue
- 502 Request Error on entire site
- Not just recipes page - admin also affected
- This is a Local by Flywheel server issue

## Diagnosis
1. Originally thought it was template-specific error
2. Found undefined function `block_template_part()` in archive-recipe.php
3. Removed/disabled the file multiple ways
4. Error persists site-wide - indicates server-level issue

## Solution Required
1. Restart Local by Flywheel site as error message suggests
2. After restart, verify recipes page loads with default archive template
3. If needed, create proper block theme template for recipes

## Next Steps
1. User needs to restart Local site
2. Check if recipes page works with default template
3. Style recipes page using CSS if needed
4. Consider updating plugin to fix block theme compatibility

## #layout Issue
- 502 server error preventing all page loads
- Not a layout issue per se, but a server/PHP fatal error
- Root cause: incompatible template functions in child theme
