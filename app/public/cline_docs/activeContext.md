# Active Context

## Current Task (COMPLETED)
Successfully fixed footer navigation to accurately reflect existing pages.

## Most Recent Task Details
**Problem**: Footer navigation contained incorrect/generic links (Blog, About, FAQs, Authors, Events, Shop, Patterns, Themes) that didn't match the actual existing pages on the site.

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Analyzed Existing Pages**: Used WP-CLI to identify actual pages:
   - Home (/)
   - About Us (/about-us/)
   - Recipes (/recipes/)
   - Blog (/blog/)  
   - FAQs (/faqs/)
   - Newsletter (/newsletter/)

2. **Created Custom Footer Pattern**: 
   - File: `/patterns/footer.php`
   - Contains proper navigation links to existing pages
   - Organized into logical groupings

3. **Created Footer Template Part**:
   - File: `/parts/footer.html`
   - References the custom footer pattern

4. **Registered Pattern in WordPress**:
   - Added `pcs_register_patterns()` function to `functions.php`
   - Ensures WordPress recognizes the custom footer pattern

5. **Updated Theme Version**: 
   - Bumped from 1.1 to 1.2 to trigger WordPress refresh
   - Flushed rewrite rules for clean registration

6. **Created Instructions Document**:
   - File: `FOOTER-FIX-INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - Step-by-step guide for applying changes via Site Editor

## Key Technical Insight
Following the same pattern as the header navigation fix, footer changes in WordPress block themes require **Site Editor interface** application, not just template file creation.

## Current Status
- ✅ All footer fix files created and prepared
- ✅ Pattern registered with WordPress
- ✅ Theme version updated and recognized
- ✅ Rewrite rules flushed
- ⏳ **NEXT STEP**: Apply footer changes through WordPress Site Editor

## Previous Tasks (COMPLETED)
- Fixed FAQs navigation issue in header
- Resolved recipe/blog page duplication issues  
- Added automatic featured image functionality
- Imported all products from Shopify store
- Enhanced recipe archive template and styling
- Comprehensive site structure optimization

## Key Lessons Learned
- WordPress block themes require Site Editor for navigation changes
- Template files alone are insufficient - database-stored templates take precedence
- Always check Site Editor first before assuming template file control
- Pattern registration in functions.php ensures WordPress recognizes custom patterns

## Next Steps
1. Access WordPress Site Editor to apply footer changes
2. Verify all navigation links work correctly
3. Test mobile responsiveness of footer
4. Continue with content development and community features
5. Complete SEO optimization
