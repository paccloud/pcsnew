        '4 Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon fillets (about 6 oz each), skin on',
        '4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened',
        '2 cloves garlic, minced',
        '1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice',
        '1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill',
        '1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley',
        '1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves',
        '1/2 teaspoon lemon zest',

        '1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper',
        'Olive oil for brushing the grill',

    ],
    'instructions' => [
        'Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (about 375Â°F to 400Â°F).',
        'In a small bowl, combine the softened butter, minced garlic, lemon juice, dill, parsley, thyme, lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Mix well to create the herb garlic butter.',
        'Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels. Check for any remaining pin bones and remove them with fish tweezers if necessary.',
        'Brush the skin side of the salmon lightly with olive oil.',
        'Clean and oil the grill grates to prevent sticking.',
        'Place the salmon on the grill skin-side down. Close the grill cover and cook for 10-13 minutes, or until the salmon is just lightly translucent in the center. Do not flip the salmon.',
        'The salmon is done when it flakes easily with a fork but is still moist and slightly translucent in the center. It will continue to cook slightly after removing from heat.',
        'When the salmon is nearly done, spread about 1 tablespoon of the herb garlic butter over each fillet and let it melt into the fish for the final minute of cooking.',
        'Carefully remove the salmon from the grill using a wide spatula.',
        'Let the salmon rest for 2-3 minutes before serving with lemon wedges and any remaining herb butter.'

    'notes' => [
        'Cedar planks make an excellent grilling surface for this recipe. If using cedar planks, soak them in water for at least 1 hour before grilling.',
        'The herb butter can be made ahead and refrigerated. Simply bring to room temperature before using.',
        'For those who prefer not to grill, this recipe works beautifully in a 375Â°F oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes until just done.',
        'Wild Sockeye salmon has a lower fat content than farmed salmon, so be careful not to overcook it.',
        'Leftover salmon makes an excellent addition to salads or breakfast dishes the next day.'
