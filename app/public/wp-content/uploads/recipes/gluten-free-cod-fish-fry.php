        '1 1/2 pounds Wild Alaskan Pacific Cod fillets, cut into 3-4 oz portions',
        '1 cup white rice flour (plus extra for dredging)',
        '1/2 cup cornstarch',
        '1 tsp baking powder',
        '1 tsp garlic powder',
        '1 tsp paprika',
        '1/2 tsp onion powder',
        '1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)',
        '1 tsp salt',
        '1/2 tsp black pepper',
        '1 cup cold seltzer water or gluten-free beer',
        '1 large egg, beaten',
        'Vegetable or canola oil for frying',
        'Lemon wedges for serving',

    'instructions' => [
        'Pat the cod fillets dry with paper towels. Season lightly with salt and pepper.',
        'Create a dredging station: Place about 1/2 cup rice flour in a shallow dish for the initial dredging.',
        'In a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 cup rice flour, cornstarch, baking powder, garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, cayenne (if using), salt, and pepper.',
        'Add the beaten egg and gradually whisk in the cold seltzer water or gluten-free beer until the batter is smooth. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter - if too thick, add a little more liquid.',
        'Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or deep fryer to 350Â°F (about 2 inches deep).',
        'Dredge each cod piece in the plain rice flour, shaking off excess, then dip into the batter, allowing excess to drip off.',
        'Carefully lower the battered fish into the hot oil, cooking in batches to avoid overcrowding (3-4 pieces at a time).',
        'Fry for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and the fish flakes easily with a fork (internal temperature of 145Â°F).',
        'Transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet or paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.',
        'Serve immediately with lemon wedges and gluten-free tartar sauce.'
    ],
    'notes' => [
        'For extra crispiness, you can double-dip the fish: after the first coating of batter, let it sit for 30 seconds, then dip again before frying.',
        'This batter works great for onion rings or vegetables too!',
        'Keep the fried fish warm in a 200Â°F oven while cooking remaining batches.',
        'Pair with coleslaw and sweet potato fries for a complete gluten-free fish fry meal.'
