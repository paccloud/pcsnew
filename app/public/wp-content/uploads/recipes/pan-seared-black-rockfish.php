    'instructions' => [
        'Pat the rockfish fillets dry with paper towels. Season both sides generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper.',
        'Place the flour on a plate and lightly dredge each fillet, shaking off any excess.',
        'Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter.',
        'Once the butter has melted and the pan is hot, add the rockfish fillets (work in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding).',
        'Cook the fillets for 3-4 minutes on the first side until golden brown and crispy.',
        'Carefully flip the fillets and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily with a fork and reaches an internal temperature of 145Â°F.',
        'Transfer the cooked fish to a warm plate and cover loosely with foil.',
        'In the same pan, reduce heat to medium and add the shallot and garlic. SautÃ© for 1 minute until fragrant, being careful not to burn the garlic.',
        'Add the white wine, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits. Simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, about 2-3 minutes.',
        'Add the lemon juice, capers, and lemon zest. Simmer for another minute.',
        'Remove the pan from heat and swirl in the cold butter pieces until melted and the sauce is slightly thickened.',
        'Stir in the fresh parsley.',
        'Spoon the sauce over the rockfish fillets and serve immediately with lemon wedges.'

    'notes' => [
        'Wild Alaskan Black Rockfish is a sustainable choice and has a delicate, flaky texture similar to snapper or sea bass.',
        'Be careful not to overcook rockfish as it can become dry. It\'s done when it flakes easily and is just opaque throughout.',
        'This recipe works well with any white-fleshed fish, including cod, halibut, or snapper.',
        'For a dairy-free version, replace the butter with additional olive oil and a touch more lemon juice.',
        'Serve with roasted potatoes and a simple green salad for a complete meal.'
