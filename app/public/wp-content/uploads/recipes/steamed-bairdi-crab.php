    'instructions' => [
        'If your crab is frozen, thaw it overnight in the refrigerator or under cold running water for faster thawing.',
        'Using kitchen shears, cut along the shell of the crab legs to make them easier to eat after cooking (optional).',

        'Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat.',
        'Place the crab clusters in the steamer basket, reduce heat to medium, and cover the pot.',
        'Steam for 6-8 minutes if the crab is pre-cooked (most frozen crab is), or 12-14 minutes if the crab is raw. The crab is done when it\'s heated through and has a bright red color.',
