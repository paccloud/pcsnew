        '4 Wild Alaskan Coho Salmon fillets (about 6 oz each), skin on',
        '3 tablespoons white miso paste',
        '2 tablespoons pure maple syrup',
        '1 tablespoon low-sodium tamari or soy sauce (use tamari for gluten-free)',
        '1 tablespoon rice vinegar',
        '1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger',
        '1 clove garlic, minced',

        '1 green onion, thinly sliced for garnish',
        '1 teaspoon sesame seeds for garnish',
        'Salt and pepper to taste'
    ],
    'instructions' => [
        'Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels and season lightly with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes while you prepare the glaze.',
        'In a small bowl, whisk together the miso paste, maple syrup, tamari or soy sauce, rice vinegar, ginger, and garlic until smooth.',
        'Reserve about 2 tablespoons of the glaze for serving, and brush the remaining glaze generously over the flesh side of the salmon fillets.',
        'Heat a large non-stick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil and swirl to coat the pan.',
        'Place the salmon fillets in the pan skin-side down. Cook without moving for about 4-5 minutes, until the skin is crispy and releases easily from the pan.',
        'Carefully flip the salmon and cook for another 2-3 minutes for medium doneness, or until the fish reaches your preferred level of doneness.',
        'Transfer to serving plates, brush with the reserved glaze, and garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds.',
        'Serve immediately with steamed rice and vegetables of your choice.'
    ],
    'notes' => [
        'For the best results, bring your salmon to room temperature for about 10-15 minutes before cooking.',
        'The reserved glaze can be heated gently in the microwave for 10-15 seconds to make it easier to brush onto the cooked salmon.',
        'You can substitute honey for maple syrup if desired.',
        'This recipe works well with other Wild Alaskan salmon varieties too, like Sockeye or King salmon.',
        'Leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 2 days and are delicious cold in a salad.'
