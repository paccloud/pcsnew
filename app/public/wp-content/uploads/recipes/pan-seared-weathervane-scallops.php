        '1 pound Wild Alaskan Weathervane Scallops (about 12-16 large scallops)',
        '2 tablespoons neutral oil (grapeseed or avocado oil)',
        'Salt and freshly ground black pepper',
        
        'For the brown butter sauce:',
        '4 tablespoons unsalted butter',
        '2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice',
        '2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped',
        '1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves',
        '1 small shallot, minced (about 2 tablespoons)',
        '1 clove garlic, minced',
        '1 tablespoon capers, drained and roughly chopped (optional)',
        'Lemon wedges for serving'

    'instructions' => [
        'Remove scallops from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to bring them to room temperature.',
        'Thoroughly pat the scallops dry with paper towels. This is crucial for achieving a good sear.',
        'Remove the small side muscle (if present) from each scallop.',
        'Season the scallops generously with salt and pepper on both sides.',
        'Heat a large stainless steel or cast-iron skillet over high heat until very hot, about 2 minutes.',
        'Add the oil to the pan and heat until it shimmers but doesn\'t smoke.',
        'Carefully place the scallops in the pan, leaving space between each one. Work in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding.',
        'Cook the scallops without moving them for about 2-3 minutes, until a golden brown crust forms on the bottom.',
        'Flip the scallops and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until the second side is golden and the scallops are just translucent in the center. They should be firm but with a slight give when pressed.',
        'Transfer the scallops to a warm plate and tent with foil while you make the sauce.',
        'Reduce heat to medium and add the butter to the same pan. Let it melt and then cook, swirling occasionally, until it turns a nutty brown color and smells toasty, about 2-3 minutes.',
        'Add the shallot and garlic and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.',
        'Remove the pan from heat and add the lemon juice (it will sizzle), capers (if using), thyme, and most of the parsley (reserve some for garnish).',
        'Return the scallops to the pan briefly to coat with the sauce and rewarm if needed.',
        'Serve immediately, spooning the brown butter sauce over the scallops and garnishing with the reserved parsley and lemon wedges.'
    ],
    'notes' => [
        'The key to perfectly seared scallops is ensuring they\'re completely dry before cooking and using a very hot pan.',
        'Don\'t overcrowd the pan when searing the scallops. Work in batches if necessary.',
        'Be careful not to overcook the scallops - they should be just opaque and slightly translucent in the center.',
        'This dish is best served immediately after cooking.',
        'For a complete meal, serve with creamy risotto or pureed cauliflower and a simple green vegetable.'
