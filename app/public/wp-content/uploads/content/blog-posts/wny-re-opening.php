In 2004, we set out to bring quality seafood from Alaska to our family and friends right here in Western New York. And now, we\'ll be doing just that. Starting in August 2020, we\'re teaming up with small-scale, high-quality fisheries around North America to bring you the very best seafood. We\'re excited about the opportunity to inform, inspire, and educate Western New Yorkers about high-quality seafood and to connect you with values-based seafood suppliers. Sound interesting? Follow us here on the blog or find us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for all the latest. Oh, and one last thing: We\'re launching a limited engagement in August at our seafood hub, located at 27 Chandler Street. Sign up below to be the first in line. We\'ll see you there!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;\n\n",
