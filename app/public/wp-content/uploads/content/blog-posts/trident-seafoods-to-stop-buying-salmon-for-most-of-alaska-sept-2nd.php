This comes as a suprise to many fishermen who invested in fishing gear, crew, insurance etc. and when the price is already low, they usually count on &quot;scratch fishing&quot; to pay the bills. This is a prime motivator for us here at pacific cloud. I have always believed we need to diversify and build our own markets. https://www.nationalfisherman.com/alaska/trident-says-chum-market-collapsed-will-stop-buying-most-alaska-salmon-sept-2&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;\n\n",
