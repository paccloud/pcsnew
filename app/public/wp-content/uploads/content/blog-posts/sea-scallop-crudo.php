This raw preparation requires the scallops to be of the highest quality and freshness. Paired with vibrant grapefruit, juicy cherry tomatoes, tangy pickled red onion, and a zesty lemon vinaigrette, this recipe is a feast for the senses. Let\'s dive into the details! Ingredients: 6-8 large fresh sea scallops 1 ruby red grapefruit, separated into wedges (membrane and pith removed) 8 orange cherry tomatoes, halved 1/2 small red onion (sliced very thin) Nasturtium and carrot micro greens (optional) Juice of 1 fresh lemon Extra virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper For the vinaigrette: Lemon juice (from 1 fresh lemon) Extra virgin olive oil (to match the amount of lemon juice) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Ensure the scallops are as fresh as possible, preferably not more than 48 hours out of the ocean. Talk to your supplier to confirm the scallops\' origin and harvest date. Choose day-boat scallops for the best quality. Prepare the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice, removing any seeds. Mix in enough olive oil to match the amount of lemon juice. Lightly season with salt and pepper. Add the thinly sliced red onion to the vinaigrette and set it aside for at least 20 minutes to marinate. Arrange the grapefruit wedges, halved cherry tomatoes, micro greens, and vinaigrette around your workstation for quick plating once the scallops are ready. Remove the scallops from the refrigerator. Work quickly to remove the side muscle (a small rectangular tag of flesh attached to the side of each scallop) and rinse the scallops in ice-cold water. Pat dry the scallops thoroughly with paper towels. Slice the scallops into disks about 1/4 inch thick. Depending on the size of the scallops, you should get 3-4 slices per scallop. On the serving plate, arrange the scallop slices in a staggered line with the grapefruit wedges and cherry tomatoes. Drizzle the lemon vinaigrette over the scallops, grapefruit, and tomatoes. Gently garnish with micro greens, such as nasturtium and carrot. This step is optional, and you can use other varieties of micro greens as well. Serve the Sea Scallop Crudo immediately for the freshest flavors and textures. Optionally, chill the plates before serving to help preserve the ingredients\' freshness. Tip: For the best results, ensure all the ingredients are of the highest quality and freshness. Discuss with your supplier to obtain the freshest sea scallops, and handle them with care during preparation. Enjoy the exquisite combination of flavors in this Sea Scallop Crudo recipe, where the sweetness of scallops meets the tanginess of grapefruit and pickled red onion, all elevated by the zesty lemon vinaigrette. It\'s a culinary masterpiece that will impress your guests and tantalize their taste buds. Bon appÃ©tit!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;\n\n",
